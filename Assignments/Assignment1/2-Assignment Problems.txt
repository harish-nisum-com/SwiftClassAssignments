Class assignment one: 

Create a Swift playground and implement the following requirements. Turn in your .playground file into the assignments folder.

Problem 1) Optional chaining
Make the "name" property in each of the classes an optional
Instantiate an Item with and set a Location and a Bin
print the value of the Location name via the Item using optional chaining

Problem 2) Protocols
Define a protocol called "DataObject" that defines a get and set for the optional "name" property
Update Item, Location and Bin to implement the protocol

Problem 3) Error Handling
Create an function called "persist" that takes a DataObject argument and throws an exception
Throw an exception if the "name" property is nil and otherwise print the name
Call the persist method and print the exception when the name is not given

Problem 4) Error Enums
Define an Error enum with an InvalidName case
Throw InvalidName in the persist method when the name is nil
